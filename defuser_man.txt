I. Fresh start

1. Introduction

The *CONFEDERATION BOMB DEFUSER v4.6* is an interface for using disarming tools on
terrorist devices.

There are two types of commands that can be sent through the program :
 * Direct instructions that will be interpreted by the defuser itself.
 * Instructions starting with '@' that will be sent to the bomb to interact with it.

Please be aware that the Confederation cannot be taken as responsible for the outcome of
any command sent to a bomb.
The Confederation also won't consider itself responsible for any galactopolitical events
the use of its tool lead to.

If you have questions, requests or improvement ideas concerning the above cited program,
you can contact us at notourproblem@gmail.com.

2. How it works (it just does you don't want to look at the code trust me)

The *CONFEDERATION BOMB DEFUSER v4.6* is based on the C++3PO language.

It will guide you through the disarming of several different devices following the
standard rules of bomb making across the galaxy.
It will do so by responding to commands you will send it and by providing you access to
this manual.
It is also an interpret between you and the problematic device thanks to its bomb-
communicating extensions.

3. The interface

Useful commands:
# exit			Close *CONFEDERATION BOMB DEFUSER v4.6*.
# help nav		Display the commands for navigating through the defuser.
# bomb view		Switch to bomb view only.
# defuser view		Switch to defuser view only.
# split view		Split the screen horizontally between the bomb and defuser views.

* [keypress] 'TAB'	Cycle through the different views.

Once launched, the *CONFEDERATION BOMB DEFUSER v4.6* presents itself on the 'DEFUSER GUI'
tab. This is the window which represents your interactions with the defuse program and all
of its tools.
The output of the commands you send to the program's command interpreter will be displayed
on this tab.

You can access a second tab called 'BOMB INTERPRETER' by calling the 'bomb_view' command.
This tab shows the output of the commands you send to the bomb you are connected to, if you
are connected to one.
To send a command specifically to the bomb, simply prefix it with a '@'.

                                          -5-

Using the 'split_view', you will switch to a view divided horizontally displaying both the
'BOMB INTERPRETER' and 'DEFUSER GUI' tabs.
The division will dynamically move right underneath the display of the first tab.

You can rapidly cycle through all the display modes by pressing the 'TAB' key on your
holo-keyboard.

The view will automatically switch to the split view if a bomb command is run while the
view is set to display only the 'DEFUSER GUI' tab or if a defuser command is run while the
view is set to dispaly only the 'BOMB INTERPRETER' tab for an uninterrupted workflow.

II. How to

4. Connecting to a bomb

Useful commands:
# help connect	Quick guide on how to connect to a bomb.
# set-port	Change the defuser output USB port.
# set-baudrate	Change the port data transfer rate.

The *CONFEDERATION BOMB DEFUSER v4.6* makes it easy to get access to a machine.
Please make sure your personal defuser is connected through USB wire to the bomb.  
You must first set the USB port you want to use as output to the bomb using 'set_port'.
After setting up a port successfully, you will have to set a baud rate with 'set_baudrate'.

Selecting the correct USB:
Obviously, the USB port you will want to chose is the one being actively connected via
cable to the machine to defuse.
To help with chosing the port, the port setting menu -which lists all active ports at the
exact moment- comes with a refresh option to help determining which one is the one you are 
looking for.


                                          -7-

Choosing a baud rate:
The baud rate corresponds to the speed at which this program will attempt to communicate
with the bomb, which has its own rate predefined.
It is primordial for them to run at the same rate to be able to exchange information
without corrupting it, which could cause the bomb to misinterpret commands you send.
There is currently no reliable way to extract the speed of a bomb without some guessing,
making it trickier to get than the port.
Here are recommended steps for guessing the correct baud rate according to your detonator :
 1) Set up a port using 'set_port'.
 2) Select an arbitrary baud via 'set_baudrate' and connect to the bomb.
 3) Check if it reacts to the connection : it should if you selected the correct port.
    If it doesn't, then try to go back to step 1 and select a different output port. 
 4) If your bomb reacts to the connection but won't output on the 'BOMB INTERPRETER', then
    you might have an incorrect baud rate selected : retry step 2 you should.
    Else the communication has been safely established with the device.

Please be careful to not send any command to the bomb while executing these steps, it might
get corrupted and misinterpreted, which could lead to you exploding.
The Confederation won't take any responsibility for casualties caused by an incorrect baud
setup.

5. Using the disarmer

This program is to be used only for defusing circuits that are being used in a bomb system.
Please refrain from connecting to any robot of the type R2D2, as they are prone to baud
overload if too many instructions are sent to them via USB.

Your commands will only have an effect it you are connected to a bomb, but never forget
that you might in fact be connected to a bomb while using this program, don't take the
situation too losely.

We won't take responsibility for any human and/or informatic error while in use of the
program.
This manual can't be considered as a justification for giving us any amount of
responsibility for what said error may have caused.

6. The Gate Firewall

The now forgotten Gate Firewall logo:

                                       [][][][]
                                     []        []
                                    []          []
                                    []          []
                                     []        []
                                       [][][][]

Although having a great name and having been used a lot in the past, the Gate Firewall with
its famous ring shaped logo doesn't stand up to its name anymore.

It is an archaic connection restriction service that even an Earthling can crack open with
ease now because of its reliance on simplistic binary 8 BUS I/O logic.

The weakness of GF protection makes it a target of choice for hackers looking for an easy
point of entry into a system.

7. About timers

Timers along with clocks are the guardians of order and reason, especially since the
development of jump drives and lightspeed travel.
It is known that a lightspeed traveler always keeps a clock on board -but also at home- to
get reminded on how the meaning of passing time really is relative. You could spend your
whole day at Tatooine watching pod racers without seeing it go by, or you could spend every
hour long minute questioning your life choices solving a bomb.

All of that to say that timers are primordial in a bomb system, which is to say that if you
get to avoid the timer to get to its goal, you might have a chance to render the whole unit
inoffensive.
A long history of badly conceived timers has been known to just give up when cut off from
their main power source. 
It is also well known among bomb lovers that removing the wrong source of electricity from
the timers of well developed bombs might make it go crazy and make them regret taking that
last decision.

It all comes down to the quality of the device you are facing.
Try at your own risk.
